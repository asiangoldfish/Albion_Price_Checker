Albion Price Checker

This project was started to make it easier to check item prices across all public market places in Albion Online.
The data will all derive from the Albion Online Data Project and all credits go to that project's contributors.

There are already many tools out there that do the exact same thing as this project aims to do, but
I started on this project because there's a lack of an interactive and standalone application. Other projects have
their GUI on a web browser or in spreadsheets. Users may already have many browser tabs open or are not comfortable with spreadsheets.
Making a simple, but easy-to-use standalone application hopefully will make the experience better.

The ultimate goal of this project is for practising with programming, getting learning how to manage data, analyze it and
make it readable by any average non-tech-minded person. As I learn more from practising in my spare time and gain knowledge from college,
more sophisticated features and complex systems will eventually be implemented.

Feel free to give tips and advices. I am more than happy to learn.
